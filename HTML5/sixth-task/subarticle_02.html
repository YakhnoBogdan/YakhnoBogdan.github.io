        <font color="#fff" size="3rem">In just the next few years, NASA aims to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972,
            including the first woman to voyage to the lunar surface. Following in the footsteps of the Apollo program,
            this 21st century lunar campaign, called Artemis, could return humans to the moon’s surface as soon as 2025.

            Named after the Greek goddess of the moon, the Artemis program was created to fly repeated trips to the moon
            so that NASA and its partner space agencies can establish a new foothold off-world. NASA officials also hope
            that Artemis will serve as the first step toward even greater ambitions in space, such as establishing a
            regular lunar presence and venturing all the way to Mars.

            The path back to the moon is a complex one with many remaining challenges, but extraordinary opportunities
            for exploration as well. Here’s the plan to land back on the lunar surface, the technology required to
            complete such a mission, and what we know about who may be selected to make the lunar odyssey.

        <font color="#fff" size="3rem">During their missions, the Artemis crews will live aboard Orion, a capsule designed to keep a
            crew of four alive and healthy in deep space for up to 21 days. Each Orion capsule will fly with a European
            Service Module, provided by the European Space Agency, that will carry solar panels, life support systems,
            fuel tanks, and the main engine needed to enter lunar orbit.

            Orion’s ride to the moon is the Space Launch System, or SLS: a 322-foot-tall rocket with a core stage that
            burns a mix of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The jumbo rocket’s first stage uses four RS-25 rocket
            engines, originally developed for the space shuttle program. Artemis I, an uncrewed test flight to the moon
            and back, will use refurbished engines that have each flown on at least three space shuttle missions.

            Each SLS rocket will also use two massive solid-fuel boosters attached on either side of the core stage.
            Combined, the rocket will generate 8.8 million pounds of thrust at launch, 15 percent more than the Apollo
            program’s Saturn V. The rocket’s upper stage will detach from the core stange once it reaches space and fire
            its own engines to send Orion (with the European Service Module) on its way moonward.

            Orion can’t land on the moon itself, so when NASA makes its lunar landing attempt during Artemis III, it
            will transfer the crew from Orion to a modified version of SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft while in lunar
            orbit. Starship, which SpaceX is currently testing, will then ferry the astronauts to and from the lunar
            surface.

            Once Orion returns to Earth, the gumdrop-shaped capsule will use its heat shields to survive the blazing
            descent through Earth’s atmosphere and then deploy parachutes for an ocean splashdown.
