            <h4 id="begining">Begining</h4>
            <p>Dinner, let us imagine, has reached its second wine. We are exchanging pleasantries: gossip,
                tittle-tattle,
                perilously keen remarks. Like a fine sauce, they pique the mind. They pass the time. A thought is peeled
                and
                placed upon a plate. A nearby lady lends us a small smile, and there are glances brilliant as the
                silver.
                Patiently we listen while another talks, because everyone, our etiquette instructs, must have his chance
                to
                speak. We wait. We draw upon the cloth with unused knives. Our goblets turn as slowly as the world.

                And on this beautiful ceremonial morning I want to talk to you about talking, that commonest of all our
                intended
                activities, for talking is our public link with one another; it is a need; it is an art; it is the chief
                instrument of all instruction; it is the most personal aspect of our private life. To those who have
                sponsored
                our appearance in the world, the first memorable moment to follow our inaugural bawl is the birth of our
                first
                word. It is that noise, a sound that is no longer a simple signal, like the greedy squalling of a gull,
                but
                a
                declaration of the incipient presence of mind, that delivers us into the human realm. Before, there was
                only
                an
                organ of energy, intake, and excretion, but now a person has begun. And in no idle, ordinary, or jesting
                sense,
                words are what that being will become. It is language which most shows a man, Ben Jonson said: “Speake
                that
                I
                may see thee.” And Emerson certainly supports him: “Man is only half himself,” he said, “the other half
                is
                his
                expression.” Truths like this have been the long companions of our life, and so we often overlook them,
                as
                we
                miss the familiar mole upon our chin, even while powdering the blemish, or running over it with a razor.

                Silence is the soul’s invisibility. We can, of course, conceal ourselves behind lies and sophistries,
                but
                when
                we speak, we are present, however careful our disguise. The monster we choose to be on Halloween says
                something
                about the monster we are. I have often gone to masquerades as myself, and in that guise no one knew I
                was
                there.

                Plato thought of the soul as an ardent debating society in which our various interests pled their
                causes;
                and
                there were honest speeches and dishonest ones; there was reason, lucid and open and lovely like the
                nakedness of
                the gods</p>

            <p>To an almost measureless degree, to know is to possess words, and all of us know how much words concern
                us
                here,
                at the university, in this context of texts. Adam created the animals and birds by naming them, and we
                name
                incessantly, conserving achievements and customs, and countries that no longer exist, in the museum of
                human
                memory. But it is not only the books which we pile about us like a building, or the papers we painfully
                compose,
                the exams we write, the calculations we come to by means of mystic diagrams, mathematical symbols,
                astrological
                charts or other ill- or well-drawn maps of the mind; it is not alone the languages we learn to
                mispronounce,
                the
                lists, the arguments and rhymes, we get by heart; it is not even our tendency to turn what is unwritten
                into
                writing with a mere look, so that rocks will suddenly say their age and origin and activity, or what is
                numb
                flesh and exposed bone will cry out that cotton candy killed it, or cancer, or canoodling, the letter C
                like
                a
                cut across an artery, the flow of meaning like blood; no, it is not the undeniable importance of these
                things
                which leads me to lay such weight upon the word; it is rather our interior self I’m concerned with, and
                therefore with the language which springs out of the most retiring and inmost parts of us, and is the
                image
                of
                its parent like a child: the words we use to convey our love to another, or to cope with anxiety, for
                instance;
                the words which will convince, persuade, which will show us clearly, or make the many one; the words I
                listen to
                when I wait out a speech at a dinner party; words which can comfort and assuage, damage and delight,
                amuse
                and
                dismay; but above all, the words which one burns like beacons against the darkness, and which together
                comprise
                the society of the silently speaking self; because all these words are but humble echoes of the words
                the
                poet
                uses when she speaks of passion, or the historian when he drives his nails through time, or when the
                psychoanalyst divines our desires as through tea leaves left at the bottom of our dreams.

                Even if the world becomes so visual that words must grow faces to save themselves, and put on smiles
                made of
                fragrant paste, and even if we all hunker down in front of films like savages before a divinity, have
                experience
                explained to us in terms of experiences which need to be explained, still, we shall not trade portraits
                of
                our
                love affairs, only of ourselves; there is no Polaroid that will develop in moments the state of our
                soul, or
                cassette to record our pangs of conscience; so we shall never talk in doodles over dinner, or call up
                our
                spirit
                to its struggle with a little private sit-com or a dreary soap. Even if the world falls silent and we
                shrink
                in
                fear within ourselves; even if words are banished to the Balkans or otherwise driven altogether out of
                hearing,
                as though every syllable were subversive (as indeed each is); all the same, when we have withdrawn from
                any
                companionship with things and people, when we have collapsed in terror behind our talcumed skins, and we
                peer
                suspiciously through the keyholes of our eyes, when we have reached the limit of our dwindle – the last
                dry
                seed
                of the self – then we shall see how greatly correct is the work of Samuel Beckett, because we shall find
                there,
                inside that seed, nothing but his featureless cell, nothing but voice, nothing but darkness and talk.

            <p>We forget sometimes that we do live with ourselves – worse luck most likely – as well as within. The head
                we inhabit is a haunted house. Nevertheless, we often ignore our own voice when it speaks to us:
                “Remember me,” the spirit says, “I am your holy ghost.” But we are bored by our own baloney. Why
                otherwise would we fall in love if not to hear that same sweet hokum from another? Still, we should
                remember that we comprise true Siamese twins, fastened by language and feeling, wed better than any bed;
                because when we talk to ourselves we divide into the self which is all ear and the self which is all
                mouth. Yet which one of us is which? Does the same self do most of the talking while a second self soaks
                it up, or is there a real conversation?

                Frequently we put on plays like a producer: one voice belongs to sister, shrill and intrepidly stupid; a
                nephew has another (he wants a cookie); the boss is next – we’ve cast him as a barnyard bully; and then
                there is a servant or a spouse, crabby and recalcitrant. All speak as they are spoken through; each runs
                around in its role like a caged squirrel, while an audience we also invent (patient, visible, too easily
                pleased) applauds the heroine or the hero because of the way they’ve righted wrongs like an avenging
                angel, answered every challenge like a Lancelot, every question like Ann Landers, and met every
                opportunity like a perfect Romeo, every romance like a living doll. If we really love the little comedy
                we’ve constructed, it’s likely to have a long run.

                Does it really matter how richly and honestly and well we speak? What is our attitude toward ourselves;
                what tone do we tend to take? Consider Hamlet, a character who escapes his circumstances and achieves
                greatness despite the fact his will wavers or he can’t remember his father’s ghost. He certainly doesn’t
                bring it off because he has an Oedipus complex (we are all supposed to have that); but because he talks
                to himself more beautifully than anyone else ever has. Consider his passion, his eloquence, his style,
                his range: “O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!” he exclaims; “now could I drink hot blood,” he
                brags; “to be or not to be,” he wonders; “O,” he hopes, “that this too too solid flesh would melt,” and
                he complains that all occasions do inform against him. For our part, what do we do? do we lick our own
                hand and play the spaniel? do we whine and wheedle or natter like a ninny? Can we formulate our anger in
                a righteous phrase, or will we be reduced to swearing like a soldier? All of us are dramatists, but how
                will we receive our training? Where can we improve upon the puerile theatricals of our parents, if not
                here among the plays and perils of Pirandello and the dialogues of Plato (among the many glories of the
                letter “P” – “peachtree” and “pulchritude,” “philosophy” and “friendship”), the operas of Puccini and
                the follies of the faculty?


                If we think awareness is like water purling gaily in its stream, we have been listening to the wrong
                James, for our consciousness is largely composed of slogans and signs, of language of one kind or other:
                we wake to an alarm; we read the weather by the brightness of a streak on the ceiling, the mood of our
                lover by the night’s cramp still clenched in her morning body; our trembling tells us we’re hung over;
                we wipe ourselves with a symbol of softness, push an ad around over our face; the scale rolls up a
                number which means “overweight,” and the innersoles of our shoes say “hush!” Thus, even if we haven’t
                uttered a word, we’ve so far spent the morning reading. Signs don’t stream. They may straggle, but they
                mostly march. Language allies itself with order. Even its fragments suggest syntax, wholeness,
                regularity, though many of us are ashamed to address ourselves in complete sentences. Rhetorically
                structured paragraphs seem pretentious to us, as if, to gaze at our image in a mirror, we had first to
                put on a tux; and this means that everything of real importance, every decision which requires care,
                thoughtful analysis, emotional distance, and mature judgment, must be talked out with someone else – a
                consequence we can’t always face, with its attendant arguments, embarrassments, counterclaims, and lies.
                To think for yourself – not narrowly, but rather as a mind – you must be able to talk to yourself: well,
                openly, and at length. You must come in from the rain of requests and responses. You must take and
                employ your time as if it were your life. And that side of you which speaks must be prepared to say
                anything so long as it is so – is seen so, felt so, thought so – and that side of you which listens must
                be ready to hear horrors, for much of what is so is horrible – horrible to see, horrible to feel,
                horrible to consider. But at length, and honestly – that is not enough. To speak well to oneself … to
                speak well we must go down as far as the bucket can be lowered. Every thought must be thought through
                from its ultimate cost back to its cheap beginnings; every perception, however profound and distant,
                must be as clear and easy as the moon; every desire must be recognized as a relative and named as
                fearlessly as Satan named his angels; finally, every feeling must be felt to its bottom where the bucket
                rests in the silt and water rises like a tower around it. To talk to ourselves well requires, then,
                endless rehearsals – rehearsals in which we revise, and the revision of the inner life strikes many
                people as hypocritical; but to think how to express some passion properly is the only way to be
                possessed by it, for unformed feelings lack impact, just as unfelt ideas lose weight. So walk around
                unrewritten, if you like. Live on broken phrases and syllable gristle, telegraphese and film reviews. No
                one will suspect … until you speak.

                There are kinds and forms of this inner speech. Many years ago, when my eldest son was about fourteen, I
                was gardening alongside the house one midday in mid-May, hidden as it happened between two bushes I was
                pruning, when Richard came out of the house in a hurry to return to school following lunch, and like a
                character in a French farce, skulking there, I overheard him talking to himself. “Well, racing fans, it
                looks … it looks like the question we’ve all been asking is about to be answered, because HERE COMES
                RICHARD GASS OUT OF THE PITS NOW! He doesn’t appear to be limping from that bad crash he had at the
                raceway yesterday – what a crash that was! – and he is certainly going straight for his car … what
                courage! … yes, he is getting into his car … not a hesitation … yes, he is going to be off in a moment
                for the track … yes –” and then he went, peddling out of my hearing, busily broadcasting his life.


                My son’s consciousness, in that moment, was not only thoroughly verbal (although its subject was the
                Indy 500, then not too many days away, and although he could still see the street he would ride on), it
                had a form: that given to his language and its referents by the radio sportscaster. Richard’s body was,
                in effect, on the air; his mind was in the booth “upstairs,” while his feelings were doubtless mixed in
                with his audience, both at home and in the stands. He was being seen, and heard, and spoken of, at the
                same time.


                Later this led me to wonder whether we all didn’t have fashions and forms in which we talked to
                ourselves; whether some of these might be habits of the most indelible sort, the spelling out of our
                secret personality; and, finally, whether they might not vitally influence the way we spoke to others,
                especially in our less formal moments – in bed, at breakfast, at the thirteenth tee. I recognized at
                once that this was certainly true of me; that although I employed many modes, there was one verbal form
                which had me completely in its grip the way Baron Munchhausen was held in his own tall tales, or the
                Piers Plowman poet in his lovely alliteration. If Richard’s was that of the radio broadcast, mine was
                that of the lecture. I realized that when I woke in the morning, I rose from bed only to ask the world
                if it had any questions. I was, almost from birth, and so I suppose by “bottom nature,” what Gertrude
                Stein called Ezra Pound – a village explainer – which, she said, was all right if you were a village,
                but if not, not; and sooner than sunrise I would be launched on an unvoiced speechification on the art
                of internal discourse, a lecture I have given many times, though rarely aloud.</p>
